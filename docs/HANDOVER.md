Living notes for whoever picks this up next. Read this, then
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md), before opening source files.

**Update this file at the end of a piece of work.** Newest entry first in the log
at the bottom; fold anything that is now permanently true into the sections
above it.

## State

Working. Typecheck and `next build` are clean, and the flows below have been
exercised against the running app.

Verified end to end on 2026-08-13: login, the Categories screen, category create
(including the duplicate-name and duplicate-code messages), asset create with an
auto-generated tag (`WRK-NUT-001` then `WRK-NUT-002`), the cross-department
category rejection, deactivate-instead-of-delete, the add-asset form's draft
surviving a trip to `/departments/new` and back, and PDF report generation.

## Environment gotchas

These have each cost a session before.

- **`npx prisma migrate dev` fails here: P3014.** The `assets` role cannot create
  the shadow database. Write the migration SQL by hand under
  `prisma/migrations/<timestamp>_<name>/migration.sql` and apply it with
  **`npx prisma migrate deploy`**. Confirm the result matches the schema with:
  ```bash
  npx prisma migrate diff --from-schema-datamodel prisma/schema.prisma \
      --to-schema-datasource prisma/schema.prisma --script   # expect "empty migration"
  ```
- **`npx prisma generate` fails with `EPERM … query_engine-windows.dll.node`**
  when the dev server is running — it holds the DLL. Stop `npm run dev` first,
  generate, then restart.
- **Never run `next build` while `next dev` is running.** They share `.next`, and
  the build overwrites the dev manifests - every page then 500s with
  `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')` and a complaint about
  the React Client Manifest. Recovery: stop node, delete `.next`, start dev again.
- **Back up before a destructive migration.** pg_dump lives at
  `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16\bin\pg_dump.exe` (not on PATH).
- **Credentials are not in the repo** — `.env` is gitignored. To get in without
  guessing:
  `npm run create-admin -- --email <addr> --name "<name>" --password "<pw>"`.
- `npm run lint` is not configured (it drops into an interactive ESLint setup
  prompt). **`npm run typecheck` is the gate.**
- `/favicon.ico` 404s in the browser console. Cosmetic, pre-existing, nobody has
  asked for one.

## Testing without a UI

There is no test suite. The cheap loop is curl against `npm run dev`:

```bash
curl -s -c jar.txt -X POST localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"...","password":"..."}'
curl -s -b jar.txt localhost:3000/api/asset-categories
```

For the interactive pieces (the combobox, the draft hand-off) drive Chrome with
the Puppeteer already in `node_modules` — the script has to sit inside the
project directory for the import to resolve, and Chrome is at
`C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe`
(`PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH` in `.env`).

## Log

### 2026-08-13 — Asset categories became real records

**Why:** `Asset.category` was free text, so the same group was spelled three ways
in one department, and asset tags could only be numbered per department
(`PRT-001`) — the label on a machine did not say what the machine was.

**What changed**

- New `AssetCategory` model, owned by a department, `name` and `code` unique per
  department. `Asset.category` (text) → `Asset.categoryId` (relation).
- Migration `20260813000000_asset_categories` backfills one category per distinct
  (department, category text) pair before dropping the old column, so nothing was
  lost. Codes were derived from the first three alphanumerics of the name.
- **Asset tags are now `DEPT-CAT-###`** (`WRK-NUT-004`). `nextAssetTag` takes a
  category, not a department. Existing `PRT-001`-style tags were left alone.
- Add-asset form: category and department are now `Combobox`es with type-ahead
  and a "+ Create …" row; a new category is created inline without leaving the
  form; "+ Create department" goes to `/departments/new` and comes back with the
  form still filled in and the new department selected (via `src/lib/form-draft.ts`).
- The asset-tag field previews the tag that will be issued and shows the last
  five tags in that category with their photos; the serial field lists serials
  already recorded in that category and warns on an exact match.
- New **Categories** tab (`/categories`): one card per department, add/edit/
  deactivate/delete its categories.
- New API: `/api/asset-categories` and `/api/asset-categories/[id]`. Creating a
  category is allowed for department heads, not admin-only.
- `?categoryId=` deep link on `/assets`, linked from the asset detail page and
  from the asset counts on the Categories screen.

**Deliberate calls**

- Categories are scoped to a department rather than global — the Categories
  screen is organised that way, and two departments naming a group the same
  thing do not mean the same thing.
- No denormalised category name on `Asset`: one source of truth, at the cost of
  an `include` in the handful of places that print it.
- A category's department cannot be edited. Every tag it has issued already
  starts with that department's code.
- Renaming a category or changing its code never rewrites existing tags.

**Known gaps**

- A photo chosen before stepping out to create a department is not preserved
  (a `File` cannot go into sessionStorage). The form says so when it restores.
- The "recently tagged" chips are read-only reminders; clicking one would only
  offer a tag that is already taken.
- Reassigning an asset to a different category is done one asset at a time
  through the asset form. There is no bulk move, and deleting a category with
  assets is refused rather than offering to move them.
